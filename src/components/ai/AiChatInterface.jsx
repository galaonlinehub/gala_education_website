    const galaEducationResponse = `A curriculum is a structured educational plan that outlines what students should learn, how they should learn it, and when they should learn it throughout their educational journey. It serves as a comprehensive framework that guides teaching and learning processes, encompassing not only the content to be taught but also the methods of instruction, assessment strategies, and the overall educational philosophy of an institution or educational system.
    
    At its core, a curriculum represents the totality of learning experiences provided to students. It includes the formal subjects and courses, the sequence in which they are presented, the teaching methodologies employed, the resources and materials used, and the evaluation methods applied to measure student progress. A well-designed curriculum aligns with educational goals and societal needs while considering the developmental stages and learning capabilities of students at different levels.


The curriculum serves multiple purposes in an educational system. It ensures consistency in educational delivery across different schools and regions, provides a roadmap for teachers to follow in their instruction, establishes standards for student achievement, and creates a framework for educational accountability. Additionally, it reflects the values, culture, and aspirations of a society, preparing students not only with academic knowledge but also with the skills and competencies needed to contribute meaningfully to their communities and the broader society.

Primary Education (Standards I-VII, ages 7-14):

Focuses on building basic literacy and numeracy skills
Covers core subjects: Kiswahili, English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Civics, Geography, History
Includes practical subjects: Agriculture, Arts and Crafts, Physical Education
Uses progressive structure where each standard builds on the previous one

Secondary Education - Two Levels:
Ordinary Level (Forms I-IV, ages 14-18):

Core subjects: Mathematics, English, Kiswahili, sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), Geography, History, Civics
Additional subjects: Computer Studies, Agriculture, Commerce, vocational subjects
Culminates in Certificate of Secondary Education Examination (Form IV) that determines eligibility for further education

Advanced Level (Forms V-VI):

For students who completed ordinary level successfully
Offers specialized, in-depth study in selected subject combinations
Three main tracks: science combinations, arts combinations, commercial combinations
Designed to prepare students for specific higher education pathways and university entrance`;
